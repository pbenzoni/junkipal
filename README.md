# Junkipal - a Junkipedia List Assistant
This Chrome extension allows users to easily add social media accounts to a Junkipedia list with a single click. The extension extracts the Twitter handle from the URL and sends it to the Junkipedia API, automatically managing authentication and handling errors.

## Features

- **Persistent Settings**: Stores the Junkipedia List ID and API Token securely using Chrome's storage, allowing for quick additions without repeated configuration.
- **Automatic Authentication**: Handles authentication with the Junkipedia API during initialization and re-authenticates when necessary.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pbenzoni/junkipedia-twitter-list-manager.git
